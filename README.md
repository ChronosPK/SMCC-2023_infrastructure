You've seen the challenges and how to solve them, now you will know how I created them.

## Sibiu Military Cyber Challenge
```plain
In this CTF, we have created a diverse range of challenges that encompass various categories and forms of creation, such as scripts, docker containers, and servers. I understand that by showing the infrastructure, files, scripts, and containers, there is a high probability that some challenges may be stolen. However, I believe it is crucial to show the process of creating these challenges to provide an insight into how they were brought to life.

By displaying the process, I aim to satisfy the curiosity of those who wonder how some challenges are created and what the whole process is like. I want to encourage others to learn from these challenges and possibly create something similar or even better.

Thus, I have decided to share the infrastructure and files used in creating these challenges, despite the risks. If you are interested in learning more about the process, you can visit my website, where I have posted details on the development of the SMCC 2023 challenges - link below.
